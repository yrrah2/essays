                        <p>An assessment of services against a quality standard will help you 
                        plan quality improvement projects. Each standard contains statement that
                        describe priority areas for improvement. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/Media/Default/About/what-we-do/Into-practice/measuring-uptake/QS-service-improvement-template.xlsm">service improvement tool</a> can help you carry out an initial assessment.</p>
                        <p>Assess each statement to understand:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>if a statement is relevant to your service</li>
                                <li>how current services compare with the statement</li>
                                <li>the source of the evidence</li>
                                <li>the actions or resources needed to improve the service so that it meets the standard</li>

        <div data-g="12 sm:8">
        <p><span>Quality standards contain associated quality measures to help you:</span></p>
        <ul>
        <li>measure levels of care</li>
        <li>develop tools and metrics</li>
        <li>measure quality improvement after implementing changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Measurement is essential to show that changes to care or services have resulted in an improvement. It's a key part of the <a href="https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/pdsa-cycles/">Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) improvement cycle</a>. If measurement shows there has been no improvement, you need to adapt the change or try something different.</p>
        <h3>Using quality measures</h3>
        <p><span>Quality measures help you calculate how well your service 
        aligns with a quality statement. They highlight changes to your service 
        that you could make. There are 3 types of measure:</span></p>
        <ul>
        <li>structure - the environment or setting</li>
        <li>process - the activity carried out</li>
        <li>outcome - the end result or impact.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Data sources</h3>
        <p>Within each quality standard we indicate where national quality 
        assured indicators currently exist that measure the quality statement.</p>
        <p>National indicators include those developed by NHS Digital through their Indicators for Quality Improvement Programme.</p>
        <p>Where national quality indicators do not exist, the quality measures 
        should form the basis for local audit and service review. Audit 
        standards or levels of expected achievement should be decided locally, 
        unless otherwise stated.</p>

        <p>An<span>&nbsp;</span>initial assessment of services against a quality standard<span>&nbsp;</span>can highlight areas where you are providing quality care and identify areas for improvement.</p>
        <p>Using quality standards as part of an assurance process (that meets 
        the needs of your board and commissioners), saves duplicated effort and 
        avoids ad-hoc requests for data.</p>
        <p>Producing an annual report is a way to demonstrate how you use 
        evidence-based guidance such as quality standards and NICE guidance. You
        can show:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>how your service meets the levels of care set out in quality standards, informed by readily available evidence</li>
        <li>progress with quality improvement projects aligned to quality standards.</li>

        <p>For an evidence-based assessment of the quality of services, you need

        <p>Standards can also be used:</p>
