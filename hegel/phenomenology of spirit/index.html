<section id="introduction">
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The Phenomenology of Spirit, or simply the Phenomenology, is a discussion about our knowledge, and the truth, and how to reduce the gap between these two concepts. Hegel’s analysis can be summed up in just two words: triadic movement. Everything for Hegel is either a movement or a moment of a movement. Art for example is a movement, whereas the Renaissance for example, is just a moment within that movement. The moments of a movement are not linear: they are triadic - they form a triad. How the triad works is that the moments are broken into three parts: first is the most basic one, then is its opposite, and finally the unity of the two. So for example in this book we first look at something from one perspective, then we look at it from the other perspective, and finally we unite the two perspectives into a new perspective.</p>
</section>
<section id="consciousness">
	<h2>Consciousness</h2>
	<p>The first question we ask, in our search for the truth, is a place to start us off, a place to look at as the source of truth. The Phenomenology of Spirit was originally titled “Science of Experience of Consciousness”. This is because we start off as mere consciousness, looking to our experience of the world as a source of truth. By the end of this chapter, we find that this path leads to problems, which then leads us to take the logically opposite path: looking to ourselves as the source of truth.
	
If you think about how you know the truth, what comes to mind? You might say that “knowing what is true” comes from understanding and thinking about what you know and deriving the truth that way. You might say that you know what is true just from seeing and hearing the world, you know that grass really is green because you can see that it's green - maybe you don’t know some more complex truth but you know that you are seeing what you’re seeing. You might even say that it is impossible to really know the truth. 

So what is Hegel’s view? Well instead of having just one view on the matter Hegel instead suggests that consciousness is a process, a development or a movement.</p>
<section id="sense-certainty">
	<h3>Sense-Certainty</h3>
	<p>First we start with the simplest, most basic way of claiming to know the truth, which is to “accept only what is immediately sensed”. What this means is simply accepting the world for what it is and nothing more.

Contradiction 1: Immediacy vs Mediation

The first two contradicting things we encounter are immediacy and mediation:

Imagine an event takes place - maybe a crime or a sports event. If you hear about it from someone else then your knowledge of the event is mediated through them. While immediacy is the lack of mediation, Hegel would argue that directly witnessing an event might still not be pure immediacy. 

If you witness an event directly your knowledge of the event might still be mediated by other things. While watching esports, even in the stadium, you are mediated by the projectors. Hegel goes so far as to say that if you see a tree and think of it as a tree then your knowledge of the object before you is mediated by your conception of what a tree is. 

So if mediation covers even your own knowledge: How is it possible to have immediate knowledge? Imagine you are in a park, lying on the grass, feeling the heat, seeing the sky, and hearing the birds. If you just take it all in as senses, without thinking of the heat as heat, the sky as the sky, etc… If you simply sense and say “this is” then you have achieved simple immediacy.

Contradiction 2: Particularity vs Universality

The next conflicting concepts to look at are particularity and universality.

Simply put: particularity is the way in which something is unique, while universality is the way in which something is not unique. Is a tree particular or universal? In other words: Is a tree unique or not? Well it is unique in that it is not the same as any other tree, but it is not unique in that it has “being a tree” in common with every other tree. Knowing what a tree is, however, would be a mediation according to Hegel and therefore our initial sense-certain consciousness accepts that everything is completely unique and particular.

What form does sense-certainty’s knowledge have? As I said previously, all it can do is say: “This, here, now” referring to its sensual experience in the moment. When sense-certainty refers to “here” it could be referring to a tree if that is what it's experiencing, but “here” might later refer to a house if it turns around. The “now” might refer to night-time, but later it might refer instead to morning. Both the basic experiences, “here” and “now”, are actually universal. They are universal because all “here”s share being “here” in common, and likewise all times (all “now”s) share being “now” in common.

The consciousness thus accepts universality.</p>
</section>
<section id="perception">
	<h3>Perception</h3>
	<p>What is happening now is called, by Hegel, Aufhebung which is usually translated to sublation. What it means is that we have transitioned to a new stage. We moved past accepting only immediacy and uniqueness, but we haven't negated it: we haven't accepted only universality, we now accept both. We don't accept the original, nor the opposite, so we have sublated to a higher stage. 

Our object, in sense-certainty, was the "this", but our object now is the "thing". Since we accept universality we can look at a mug and instead of simply saying "I am experiencing this" we can now say "I perceive this thing" and instead of taking in our senses we can now form concepts from it: greenness, roughness, sweetness. 

So what is the contradiction that we are dealing with in this section? Hegel is going to play around with a concept that he uses lots of different terms for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Unity and Multiplicity</li>
	<li>The One and the Also</li>
	<li>Intrinsic distinctiveness and Extrinsic diversity</li>
</ul>
	
What he is describing is how a thing - for example a mug - is a unity, it's One mug, and it's also a multiplicity of qualities: it's also white, it's also round, it's also solid, smooth, etc… Intrinsic distinctiveness is the same thing: the thing is intrinsically distinctive from other things but it also exhibits extrinsic diversity with its many qualities. 

Hopefully you can see that these concepts are very similar to the old set of immediacy and mediation from sense-certainty. If we accept that every thing is a unity then we can't distinguish between any thing and we are back to sense-certainty. If we accept that things are single things and also a collection of properties then we are stuck in this unstable perception that is trying to reconcile the contradiction. If we accept only the multiplicity of properties and not the unity of the thing, then the thing ceases to be. If we did accept just that then we would have to understand that the properties: whiteness, roughness don't exist by themselves but they exist as a result of something else. 

That understanding is the namesake of the next section that we sublate to: Forces and Understanding where forces are whatever it is that is giving rise to our perceptions. 
</section>
<section id="understanding">
	<h3>Understanding</h3>
	<p>We then move on to the final part of the first chapter. We still believe that the origin of truth comes from our senses and experience of the world, but instead of believing our senses tell us the full truth we instead use our senses to discover deeper, hidden truths. This view is roughly what most phyisicists believe, it's what most scientists believe, and frankly it is what most people believe full stop. The world is full of real things such as atoms, or quarks, intangible things like forces, and maybe even just mathematics itself. These things cannot be directly sensed, but it doesn't mean that they aren't real or can be discovered.

The problem that we run into with this line of thinking is how we can know anything about these underlying forces if they are invisible to our senses. How we get around this is by discovering or creating laws which explain why things happen the way they do.

This approach to unveiling the truth from behind their appearances has two major problems:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Firstly he notices the trend for laws to be consolidated
	<ul>
		<li>Galileo's Law of Fall explains how things fall</li>
		<li>Kepler's Law of Planetary Motion explains how the planets move</li>
		<li>Newton's Law of General Gravitation consolidated both those laws into one grand law</li>
		<li>Einstein's Theory of Relativity further condensed that together with the Laws of Motion and Attraction, etc</li>
		<li>The consolidation of laws into grand laws actually makes them less specific, less useful, and makes you understand less about the world.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>The second issue is that laws don't actually explain anything. They merely describe things. Laws don't help explain why things happen at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>The more laws we create, or discover, we never actually get any closer. This realization finally tears down this view of taking our experiences of the other as true, and we move to the opposite position, that the source of truth is from ourselves. The name of this stage is thus self-consciousness - we are conscious of our selves.</p>
</section>
		</section>
<section id="self-consciousness">
	<h2>Self-Consciousness</h2>

When the consciousness was certain of the other, the existence of the self was causing problems like universality and unity. These internal conflicts, between the self and the self, were driving the movement in consciousness from one stage to another. 

Now that self-consciousness is certain of the self, the existence of the other will cause problems. These external conflicts, between the self and the other, are going to drive the movement between stages in 3 parts starting with the conflict between the self and other objects. 
<section id="self-vs-other-objects">
	<h3>Self vs Other Objects</h3>
	<p>When we come across objects, they initially pose an interesting problem. If all I believe in is myself, what should I think about these objects in the world that are not me? The answer to this problem is actually relatively simple: we can just assert that objects are a part of ourselves. We can assimilate them into ourselves and assert that objects in the world are merely constructions of our own thoughts.</p>
	</section>
<section id="self-vs-other-selves">
	<h3>Self vs Other Selves</h3>
	<p>The real problem arises when we encounter another self-consciousness. Other objects can be a part of our own creation, but other people clearly represent something equal to ourselves, it isn't so easy to just write them off as a mere object in my world if I see that they have just as much right to do the same of me. There are two paths we can take with this problem:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> the first we are both objects -> consciousness</li>
		<li> second ignore our worries and press on in viewing other people as mere objects in our world</li>
		<li>third accept that I am part of their world.</li>
		<li>fourth comes later</li>
	</ul>
		<p>Hegel then begins to tell a story where two people engage in a "struggle to the death". At some point in the struggle one of the two gives in and says “You win, do what you want, but dont kill me.”  This results in an imbalanced relationship famously titled Herrschaft und Knechtschaft - translated as Master and Slave, or Lordship and Bondage. 

The lord (the winner of the struggle) then puts the bondsman (the loser of the struggle) to work. The bondsman is sent out to find and make objects for the lord to satisfy their desires. This dynamic, however, leads the lord to become lazy and complacent and the bondsman, who is doing all the work, to develop their skills and become more developed.

This story, known as the “Master-Slave dialectic”, is by far the most well known section of the Phenomenology and is Hegel’s way of presenting two problems with self-certainty:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you assert that certainty only extends to your own self and to no other selves, in other words taking the position of the Lord, then the problem of the existence of other selves is solved: you can assimilate them into your world as part of yourself. The problem with this is that it provides no path for the development that Hegel is looking for.</li>
	<li>If you instead acknowledge the existence of others, you are taking the same philosophical view as the Bondsman. Hegel is much more interested in this position because he says that it leads to further development through analysing the problem of freedom. </li>
</ul>

Hegel moves on to two philosophies that look as if they might solve this problem:

The first is Stoicism, which is philosophy that originated in ancient Greece and Rome and was believed by many actual slaves of the time. Stoicism’s main idea that we can draw back into ourselves. Sure there might be wars, or famines, or I might literally be a slave, but at least I can draw back into my own mind and find that I at least have my own inner freedom.

This is a nice solution but where stoicism falls down is that it then begins to introduce concepts such as good, wisdom, and virtue. These concepts have no basis in stoicism. Hegel will reintroduce these concepts later but only after laying down a foundation for them. Stoicism tells you to draw into your own thought but then pulls out alien concepts from somewhere else.

Hegel then moves on to Skepticism. Skepticism is similar to stoicism except for the additional concepts. When it comes to certainty, skepticism has none. Hegel views skepticism as an ideological pit that you can fall into with few ways out. His main issue with skepticism is that it provides no freedom. For the slave analogy the slave does get a sense of freedom from the flawed perspective of stoicism, but gets nothing out of skepticism. As for the actual topic of the book, certainty, we get absolutely nothing from skepticism.
	</section>
<section id="self-vs-divinity">
	<h3>Self vs Divinity</h3>

The failure of stoicism and skepticism to arrive at freedom or certainty leads us to become what Hegel calls "Unhappy Consciousness". To break out of this unhappiness, Hegel begins a new story: this time about God.

Hegel presents God as a static, unchanging, infinite being. We on the other hand are changing, finite beings. God is universal, whereas we are merely particular. Most importantly, God is an example of a perfect self-consciousness: when it comes to encountering other objects, God is universal, and as such they are a part of God; when it comes to encountering self-consciousnesses, they exist within God too.

The story begins with a self-consciousness entering into a subservient relationship with God, mirroring the master-slave relationship from before. This time, however, the self-consciousness is happy to take that position with respect to God rather than a mere self-consciousness like themselves. As the self-consciousness tries to get closer to the divine, it requires a “divine mediator” AKA a priest. They completely devote themself to the priest and surrender whatever they possess to them. However, as they get closer to the priest, the more they realise that the priest is just another self-consciousness like them, and that the priest has no greater connection to God than they do. After this, they try to bypass the priest as an unnecessary mediator and gain access to God directly. This leads them to a revelation: The unchanging, the thing being desired throughout self-consciousness  is, in the end, reason. 
</section>
	</section>
<section id="reason">
	<h2>Reason</h2>
	<p>We now enter a new section of the book where we don't simply take the self to be the most basic truth, nor simply the other, but instead we take them both together as one unity: I am everything, everything is me. Hegel calls this view of being all reality “idealism”. Initially, however, it is “empty idealism” because there is no positive reason to believe in this idealism, but it is believed regardless.

The new goal is to “fill” this empty idealism. What we need to know our place in the world. We need to look at the world and see our place in it, and we need to look at ourselves and see the world in us. How we will do this is triadically: first we will observe the world and try to find our place in it that way, then we will try to make our place in the world through our own actions, and finally we will explore a union of the two ways.</p>
	<h3>Observing Reason</h3>

	<h4>Observing Nature</h4>
	<p>Once again we will begin with immediacy, which in this case is viewing ourselves as mere physical objects. Objects which obey, and can be predicted by, the laws of motion, chemistry, etc… 

The laws that apply to chemicals and moving objects for example are very rigid and predictable, but there are some elements of the Natural world that cannot be explained purely through the Natural Laws: living things may fall in the same way as rocks, and they might boil or freeze at expected temperatures, but they are still completely unpredictable from the perspective of these simple laws.</p>
	<h4>Observing Organic Nature</h4>
	<p>We then move on to observation of Organic Nature

In this shape we now split Nature into two parts: Organic and Inorganic. The Observations that we learned in the Observation of Nature still apply here, but to understand and predict the specific behaviour of the Organic beings we must create new laws to bring order to this new stage. With organic beings we are also closer to seeing ourselves in the world: It is no coincidence that the focus of this new stage, which we singled out as not containing order, also bears a closer resemblance to ourselves. While we are a Natural thing, we identify even more with being an Organic thing: this shape of Observing Reason sees ourselves as a homo sapien. At the same time when we look at an organic thing we can see a real and believable purpose. In fact organic things have two kinds of purpose: firstly organisms are born with features such as claws which clearly are there for a reason and therefore indicate purpose of some kind, secondly organisms react to things as they happen and show a much more relatable purpose for us.

Hegel refers to this purpose, both types, as the “Inner” of an organism , in contrast with its “Outer” which is all the physical versions of the Inner Purpose. Since there is no “purpose” part of our body, Hegel separates this Inner into 3 parts:
<ul>
	<li>Sensitivity - which refers to a organism’s  senses, the way it is made aware of the world</li>
	<li>Irritability - which concerns the organism’s reactions</li>
	<li>Reproduction - which concerns the self-preservation of an organism</li>
</ul>
	
The Outer equivalents for these Inner parts are
<ul>
	<li>The nervous system</li>
	<li>The muscular system</li>
	<li>The digestive and reproductive systems</li>
</ul>

Now once again we start identifying problems:
<ul>
	<li>Organisms’ purposes cannot be broken into parts because they actually function as one whole</li>
	<li>Organisms’ biology also cannot be broken up because it would kill them</li>
</ul>

	<h4>Observing Self-Consciousness</h4>
	<p>Finally we move to a new shape of Observing Reason: Observation of Self-consciousness

While, of course, we still accept the observations made of Nature, and of Organic Nature (including Conscious Organic Nature), we now focus on Nature which is conscious of itself: human beings (Self-conscious conscious organic nature). Notice again that as we close in on a more specific thing that is hard to predict with our basic laws, we are closing in on ourselves and therefore finding something that we can identify with even more. This new shape observes other people in the world as having the same purpose as us, and sees ourselves as examples of people.

Observation of Self-consciousness is split into two parts reflecting the Inner and Outer of people. 
We start by observing the Inner of people, both other people and ourselves, and so Hegel begins with observing our own thoughts. The laws that he employs to predict our thoughts are the laws of logic, for example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Whatever is, is</li>
		<li>Nothing can both be and not be</li>
		<li>Everything must either be or not be</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You might initially think that this approach represents form (order) too strongly and has no content (real world meaning) but Hegel sees it differently: Hegel says that this logic-based approach is actually too focused on content. It is focused on observing our thoughts but spends no time explaining why we have the thoughts we do. It has no ability to predict thought and therefore brings no order / form. 

We can then move from pure thought to psychology which is still focused on our Inner. Psychology is different in that it tries to predict our behaviour based on our environment and upbringing. 

Hegel is going to reject the idea that we can predict the behaviour of a person using factors from their environment and upbringing but his approach is not a common one. He agrees that whatever a person does is ultimately determined by these external factors but he doesn’t think that it is possible to create laws regarding them for the following reasons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Even if it was possible to learn all of the external factors that an individual has experienced, you still would have no other example to contrast it with. There are no two people who have had the exact same experiences for their whole life.</li>
		<li>If you try to divide it into a collection of experiences, for example
		<ul>
			<li>Growing up poor</li>
			<li>Being from a particular country</li>
			<li>Having children</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>You cannot create any laws regarding these because Hegel says that we can choose which experiences of ours affect our nature.</li>
		<li>This is not an argument for free speech but simply saying that the choice ( the choice that we make about which part of our experience we will let define our character ) is determined by the sum of all our experiences. </li>
		<li>So in summary we cannot use the sum of all of our experiences because it is unique, and we cannot break it into parts because they all reduce to being about the whole sum again.
	We then move to the second part of Observing Self-consciousness: The Outer</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If we cannot predict people from observing their Inner, maybe we can predict their behaviour from their Outer. Hegel brings up two specific practices at the time he was writing: Physiognomy and Phrenology. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Physiognomy is the study of people’s physical appearance and in particular their face.
		<ul>
			<li>Slimy people have a particular look</li>
			<li>Honest people have a specific look</li>
			<li>Smart people have a specific nose length</li>
			<li>Stupid people have a specific teeth length</li>
			<li>etc…</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Phrenology is the study of people’s skulls.
		<ul>
			<li>Certain types have certain skull shapes</li>
			<li>Thieves might all have a specific bump in a specific part of their skull</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Hegel’s critique of using Physiognomy and Phrenology to study and predict someone’s behaviour is of course based on practices at the time, but his discussion of them can be compared to modern pseudo-sciences such as racism, horoscopes, zodiacs, etc… His dislike of them stems from the fact that they simply notice some empty correlations and don't successfully justify how your skull shape can make someone dishonest for example. 

He says "In content, however, such observations cannot differ in value from these: 'It always rains at our annual fair', says the dealer; 'And every time, too,' says the housewife, 'when I am drying my washing.'"

and later he even more aggressively points out that “If any one said, 'You act, certainly, like an honest man, but I can see from your face you are forcing yourself to do so, and are a rogue at heart,' without a doubt every brave fellow to the end of time when accosted in that fashion will retort with a box on the ear." Basically he is saying that if someone does honest work, it is incredibly foolish to accuse them of actually being dishonest because of their face. 

Hegel finally closes off the Observing Reason section quite famously with a dick joke, or more accurately a joke about genitalia, where he says that Observing Reason cannot even explain why the highest and the lowest of our bodies - the highest being sex and the lowest being urination - find physical expression in one organ: the genitals.

“The ignorance of this consciousness about what it says are the same kind of connection of higher and lower which, in the case of the living being, nature itself naively expresses in the combination of the organ of its highest fulfillment, the organ of generation, with the organ
of urination.”

He then finishes with a pun by saying that thus far all we have been doing is effectively “pissing around”.

“The infinite judgment as infinite would be the completion of self-comprehending life, whereas the consciousness of the infinite judgment which remains within representational thought conducts itself like pissing (pissen).”</p>
	<h3>Active Reason</h3>

	<h4>Pleasure and Necessity</h4>

The story begins with Active Reason changing its attempt to find itself at home in the world completely. Instead of looking outward through Observation we are now going to look inward in an approach that many people will find relatable. The approach is pursuing pleasure. The rationale, I guess, is that trying to satisfy our pleasures is a way of feeling like you are a part of the world. Many commentators have suggested that Hegel isn’t just talking about simple pleasures like eating and sleeping, but that he is also talking about sex.

The name of the first section of Active Reason is actually Pleasure and Necessity where pleasure represents the inward looking attempt to feel at home in the world, and necessity represents the way that the world intrudes in on our attempt. Some commentators equate “Necessity” with “The necessity of death” but Hegel is really talking about all kinds of necessity including the fact that we have to earn money to get our pleasures and that we have to sustain our bodies, etc…

	<h4>Law of the Heart</h4>

The contradiction between pursuing pleasure and the intrusion of outside necessity results in us moving to a new stage where we now focus on pursuing our own vision for the world, and pushing our views onto others. Hegel calls this vision the Law of our Heart which is both a very beautiful name, and it also contrasts well with the laws in the Observing Reason which were observational laws while this one is of my own heart. In pursuing the Law of the Heart we initially rally against the state, the church and the social order as enemies of our law.

Then, as per usual, Hegel begins listing the problems with this stage:
<ul>
	<li>This consciousness comes to see that others may not identify themselves with its social programme, just as it did not identify with the social programme that already existed, leading it to adopt a contradictory dismissiveness to the ‘hearts’ of others:
	<ul>
		<li>Others do not ﬁnd in this content the fulﬁllment of the law of their hearts, but rather that of someone else; and, precisely in accordance with the universal law that each shall ﬁnd in what is law his own heart, they turn against the reality he has set up, just as he turned against theirs. Thus, just as the individual at ﬁrst ﬁnds only the rigid law, now he ﬁnds the hearts of men themselves, opposed to his excellent intentions and detestable’ (PS: 224).</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>It also comes to ﬁnd that others may oppose it in the name of the existing order, so it can no longer reject that order as alien to the will of individuals:
	<ul>
		<li>It took this divine and human ordinance which it found as an accepted authority to be a dead authority in which not only its own self – to which it clings as this particular independent heart opposed to the universal – but also those subject to that ordinance would have no consciousness of themselves; but it ﬁnds that this ordinance is really annihilated by the consciousness of all, that it is the law of every heart’</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>The name of this section is actually “The Law of the Heart and the Insanity of Self-Conceit” and so it is at this part after facing these problems that ‘the law of the heart’ becomes ‘the frenzy of self-conceit’
	<ul>
		<li>The heart-throb for the welfare of humanity therefore passes into the ravings of an insane self-conceit, into the fury of consciousness to preserve itself from destruction”</li>
		<li>It therefore speaks of the universal order as a perversion of the law of the heart and its happiness, a perversion invented by fanatical priests, gluttonous despots and their minions, who compensate themselves for their own degradation by degrading and oppressing others, a perversion which has led to the nameless misery of deluded mankind’.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
	<h4>Virtue</h4>

We then move on to the third stage of Active Reason which is “Virtue and the Way of the World”, but we actually begin with the Way of the World. As far as we are concerned at this stage everyone is just selfishly pursuing the laws of their own hearts and this is the way of the world that we have come to despise. Our new way of opposing the Way of the World is not to push for our own personal Law of our Heart but instead to pursue virtue - a universal and selfless good. This approach, however, suffers from two major problems:
<ul>
	<li>Virtue is just the Law of the Heart again with a different name.</li>
	<li>The things that the "knight of virtue" pretends to care about ends up being empty: "Virtue utters ‘empty, ineffectual words’ which ‘edify, but raise no edifice"</li>
</ul>

	<h4>Practical Reason</h4>

The emptiness of this position leads us to the final part of the Reason chapter which is titled "Individuality Which Takes Itself To Be Real In And For Itself" but I will refer to it as "Practical Reason". This stage begins to really focus on individuality. You might think of individuality as your personality or maybe as your legal identity but what Hegel means by individuality is very general: it is whatever makes you, you. 

If you think about "what makes you, you", there are two main perspectives: firstly that I am an individual because I share qualities with other individuals, the second perspective is that I am an individual because I am different from other individuals - I am not them, I am this individual. Hopefully you now are starting to get an appreciation for the poetry in this book: it almost rhymes. I sound like George Lucas when I say that but this book genuinely does have symmetry. The issue of individuality is broken down, once again, into particularity and universality. 

This concept of individuality was there in the previous sections of Reason but it was pushed to the side:
<ul>
	<li>In Observing Reason, "what made us, us" was firstly that we were a physical object, then that we were an animal, then that we were a person. We didn't focus on what made us unique but rather what made us an individual. In other words we are an individual because of universality. </li>
	<li>In Active Reason, "what made us, us" was the things that we were taking pleasure in, the law of our hearts, the fact that we alone were pursuing virtue. In other words we are an individual because of our particularity. </li>
</ul>
	<h3>Spiritual Animal Kingdom</h3>

Now in Practical Reason we are going to try to find a way to understand our individuality while accepting both the particular and universal aspects of it, and we do this by looking at "action". 

At the end of Observing Reason, one of Hegel's critiques of Physiognomy was that they were trying to understand the individual by studying facial expressions but Hegel pointed out that our facial expression is under our own control, that it was one of our ways of expressing ourselves, one of our actions, and that we are actually the result of all of our actions put together. This new section of Practical Reason will continue with that line of thought except now focused on accepting the individual as a particular and universal thing.

The initial view is quite simple: similar to in Observing Reason, every individual has an inner purpose. This purpose is what causes us to perform the actions that we perform. This view is also similar to Active Reason because it focuses on the way in which the individual makes their impression on the world through their actions.

This view initially seems good: my actions express who I am, the actions of others express who they are. The problem is that sometimes I make mistakes, and sometimes I have an idea in my head which my actions don’t successfully carry out and as a result I feel alienated when I look back on my own actions. Additionally when I look back on my prior actions I see the work of a different person, someone who has different views and experiences to the current me.

	<h4>Law-Giving Reason</h4>

In this shape of reason, the objective is still the so called “what really matters” but instead of individual against individual we see that “what really matters” is the object of the whole community AKA the “ethical community”. Hegel moves on from referring to it as “what really matters” to calling it “ethical substance” because we are concerned with the substance of the ethical community, with the substance of ethics itself. We are still in the reason section, however, and therefore we as individuals will try to determine this ethical substance for ourselves. The first approach is, of course, the immediate one: if the ethical substance is universal for everyone then it should be immediately obvious. This is where we start to come up with maxims which seem obvious to us such as 
<ul>
	<li>“Everyone ought to speak the truth.” - The problem with this is that not everyone knows the truth, so the maxim has to be changed to</li>
	<li>“Everyone ought to speak the truth if they know it.” - The problem with this maxim is that no one can know if what they think it really the truth, so we have to change the maxim to</li>
	<li>“Everyone ought to speak what they think.” - At this point the maxim is so watered down that it has become meaningless.</li>
</ul>
	<p>This problem of obvious maxims being watered down leads us to the next stage.</p>

	<h4>Law-Testing Reason</h4>

The next stage is called “Law-testing Reason” and it is partially based on Emmanuel Kant's idea that we can arrive at a moral law by thinking it through logically. To analyze this idea he uses the idea of property, as in the idea that certain objects can belong to some individuals:
<ul>
	<li>This idea is important because it governs things like theft</li>
	<li>Property in and of itself has no logical contradictions, since it is just a simple idea
	<ul>
		<li>Lack of property has no logical contradictions either</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

	<h2>Spirit</h2>

	<h3>Ethical Spirit</h3>

	<h4>Ancient Greece</h4>
<p>
The first historical setting that Hegel examines is Ancient Greece. 

Hegel tells us that ethics in Ancient Greece was split into two parts: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The first is what he calls the “Family Sphere”. This side was dominated by women, the family and the gods. For men the family sphere was most important at birth and growing up, and then at death.</li>
	<li>The family sphere is contrasted with the “State Sphere”. This side was dominated by men, the state, and the military. For men the state sphere is where they spend most of their life, before returning to the family sphere.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This system initially seems functional: women can be in charge of family related issues like burials and weddings, while men can be in charge of state and war. While it is not progressive or ideal, it at least appears to function. Hegel points out, however, that in cases where the two spheres come into conflict there is no resolution.

To explain his point he uses the 5th Century BCE play “Antigone” by Sophocles. In the play a man named Polynices dies in a civil war for the control of the city Thebes. After the civil war, the new king Creon publicly condemns Polynices and rules that he cannot be formally buried. This presents a problem for Polynices’ sister, Antigone: should she obey the state and refuse to perform a burial for her brother, or should she obey the gods?

The point Hegel is making with a reference to this play is that there is no correct solution, at least not using Greece’s ethical system.
</p>
	<h4>Ancient Rome</h4>

We then move on to Ancient Rome which still uses an ethical system but this one is a singular sphere all under the legitimacy of the emperor.

	<h4>General Interest vs Self Interest</h4>
	<h4>Noble vs Ignoble</h4>
	<h4>The Enlightenment</h4>
<p>
	Faith locates the essence – the ultimately true – in the supersensuous beyond, insight locates it in the self. Each sees the other as its opposite.

Insight: the object of faith does not exist outside the believer’s own consciousness, it is actually ‘a product of consciousness itself’
Faith: far from being ‘new wisdom’, this is what it has always held, in viewing the deity and itself as one. Faith feels confirmed by God and places their trust in Him.
Faith: This first charge is in tension with the claim that religious belief is a deception brought about by priests and despots: for if the object of faith is something they have created, how can it be ‘alien’ to them?
Faith is also aware that God becomes the ‘spirit of the community’ thanks to the activity of the faithful and that this spirit is thus partly the ‘product’ of consciousness.
Insight condemns faith for worshipping mere objects like pieces of stone, blocks of wood or wafers made of bread
Faith does not revere any such merely physical things. 
The Enlightenment attacks the Bible as a historical document
Faith has no such reliance on evidence, and only a religious consciousness that has been corrupted by the Enlightenment could think otherwise
The Enlightenment accuses faith of a foolish asceticism (abstinence from sensual pleasures) and self-denying disregard for material property. 
But faith easily shows the worldliness of pure insight to be empty of real value, in holding ‘a meal or the possession of things . . . to be an End in itself’ (PS: 339), while also being hypocritical: ‘[Pure insight] affirms as a pure intention the necessity of rising above natural existence, above acquisitiveness about the means of existence; only it finds it foolish and wrong that this elevation should be demonstrated by deeds; in other words, this pure insight is in truth a deception, which feigns and demands an inner elevation, but declares that it is superfluous, foolish, and even wrong to be in earnest about it, to put this elevation into actual practice and demonstrate its truth . . . It is thus that Enlightenment lets itself be understood by faith’
The Enlightenment saves faith from the hypocrisy of its asceticism, which involves the token sacriﬁce of goods in a way that is essentially meaningless; but again, the Enlightenment moves too quickly from this valid criticism, to thinking
that no attempt to control the desire for pleasure has any signiﬁcance.



The problem with insight, from faith’s perspective, is that it does not enter into and understand faith’s perspective. All insight can see in faith is a failure of insight into the nature of faith itself; but this blinds insight to faith’s own point of view. In each case, therefore, what insight attacks is not what faith takes itself to be, but what insight takes to be opposed to 
insight. It only ever attacks its own other.

Hegel then turns from an examination of the Enlightenment’s critical position, to its positive position, again as viewed through the eyes of faith: ‘If all prejudice and superstition have been banished, the question arises, What next? What is the truth Enlightenment has propagated in their stead?’

In so far as the Enlightenment has a place for God at all, it will be as the empty God of deism, a mere ‘vacuum to which no determinations, no predicates, can be attributed’
The Enlightenment returns us to the simplistic empiricism of Observing Reason. Over against this empty absolute, insight sees a world of individual, sensuous things – the world of nature. Insight then relates the objects of nature to the absolute.


On the one hand, insight maintains, the 
absolute ‘makes, fosters and cherishes’ the things of the world, 
which thus have ‘intrinsic being’ (or are an sich). On the other 
hand, created things are the opposite of the absolute and so are not
absolute in themselves. In this latter respect, things are available for 
other things to use; insofar as they have intrinsic being, however, 
they can in turn put other things to use. The principle governing 
the world of enlightenment, therefore, is that ‘everything is useful’ 




The Enlightenment adopts the value-system of utility, and an instrumental view of the world and others: ‘Just as everything is useful to man, so man is useful too, and his vocation is to make himself a member of the group, of use to the common good and serviceable to all’



To all this faith will respond with disgust.

Despite this the Enlightenment forces Faith to deepen their self-understanding, and prevent them from becoming dogmatic irrationalism. To faith the Enlightenment merely appears to be hostile, in fact it helps bring out the way in which faith tries to mediate and relate God and man, revelation and reason, inner and
outer, and so stops faith from becoming one-sided: 

‘Consequently, [the Enlightenment] is neither alien to faith, nor can faith disavow it’

At the same time, the Enlightenment is insufﬁciently dialectical about its own position vis-à-vis faith, in failing to see how much common ground they share. 

Nonetheless, while the Enlightenment can help faith to develop into a more sophisticated religious standpoint (hence its effectiveness), this will not be immediately apparent to faith itself, since it will initially seem to the faithful that the Enlightenment has simply destroyed all the old certainties:

Enlightenment, then, holds an irresistible authority over faith because, in the believer’s own consciousness, are found the very moments which Enlightenment has established as valid.

Examining the effects of this authority more closely, its behaviour towards faith seems to rend asunder the beautiful unity of trust and immediate certainty, to pollute its spiritual consciousness with mean thoughts of sensuous reality, to destroy the soul which is composed and secure in its submission, by the vanity of the Understanding and of self-will and self-fulfilment. 

But as a matter of fact, the result of the Enlightenment is rather to do away with the thoughtless, or rather non-notional, separation which is present in faith. More specifically, insight ‘reminds faith, when one of its modes is present to it, of the others which it also has, but which it always forgets when the other one is present’. The overall effect of insight’s critique is thus to make faith aware that its different views of itself and the absolute are all one-sided and partial. As such, they all reflect faith’s finite perspective – the perspective it has through belonging to this world, to the earth. This means, however, that faith’s pure, infinite consciousness is left completely without content, with an utterly ‘empty beyond’. Faith, therefore, comes to share the very same consciousness as enlightenment: 

Both now relate to ‘an absolute without predicates, an absolute unknown and unknowable’. 

Insight, by contrast, considers the absolute in a more positive way to be its own essential, albeit abstract, object – what Hegel calls ‘the pure Thing’. It takes itself to be finite consciousness over against 
this pure, absolute ‘thing’. As such, however, it finds that it stands in a twofold relation to the absolute. 
On the one hand, insight takes the latter to be a simple ‘predicateless absolute’ – the abstract deity of Deism. 
On the other hand, it starts from its finite, sensuous perception of things and, by stripping away what we see and hear, proceeds to the thought of pure matter in the abstract – the absolute object of eighteenth-century French Materialism. 


The Enlightenment, Hegel claims, is essentially split between two camps, of deism on the one hand and materialism on the other, where in fact for both camps the central categories of God and matter
are equally abstract and empty. Underlying both, however, is an essential humanism, and a commitment to the happiness of mankind as the fundamental value – that is, a commitment to utility: ‘The Useful is
the object in so far as self-consciousness penetrates it and has in it the
certainty of its individual self, its enjoyment (its being-for-self) . . .
The two worlds are reconciled and heaven is transplanted to earth
below’ (PS: 355).

The next shape of enlightenment takes 
its object to be explicitly differentiated. As such, however, this object is no longer the empty, abstract absolute of Deism and Materialism, but the world of manifold finite things that insight confronts. This is 
the world in which all things have their own intrinsic being but in which they are also related to, and at the disposal 
of, other things (are ‘for an other’) – the world in which, as we saw 
above, everything is useful to everything else (§580/383).
Insight is now more explicitly self-conscious than when conscious 
of the empty absolute or pure matter: for in the world of utility, it 
encounters a realm in which everything is there for it, indeed there 
for it, as this finite individual, to enjoy. In its own eyes, therefore, it 
finds complete satisfaction in its world (§581/384). Yet insight does 
not see its selfhood as such in that world, but sees itself only in the 
availability to it of self-less objects (§582/385).69
 In the next shape 
of spirit, however, consciousness sees itself explicitly in its world, 
and so takes itself to be absolutely self-relating and free.

 Hegel has warned us, however, that such optimism
is premature: the shadow is cast in the following part of this section,
entitled ‘Absolute Freedom and Terror’, where Hegel offers his famous
analysis of the French Revolution.
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>Moral Spirit</h3>

	<h4>Moral Worldview</h4>

Duty

The idea of “morality” as a system of rules dictated by the very structure of practical reason itself looked like it was itself fashioned, as it were, to provide the theoretical structure for the modern life that the French Revolution brought about in practice.

However, the Kantian insistence that moral action should always be done out of the motive not of personal happiness but out of duty, coupled with Kant’s equal insistence that we could also not be expected to renounce our happiness and become moral drudges, led to a series of conceptual knots that “morality” on its own seemed unable to untie. 

The moral world-view
Since moral self-consciousness knows its own pure will to be what
is essential, it takes the latter to have absolute authority over it as
an individual. Accordingly, it conceives of its pure will as the source
of binding duty (§599/395). Such consciousness also relates to a
world that is quite other than it: the realm of nature. In the eyes
of morality, however, nature counts for nothing, whereas duty is
essential (§600/396). Moral consciousness feels bound, therefore, to
assert and fulfil its duty in the realm of nature itself. In so doing, it
also seeks to carry out its aim as a moral individual and so to achieve
satisfaction or ‘happiness’ in the fulfilling of its duty (§602/397).
Yet the moral individual finds external nature to be indifferent to
his aim; he thus learns that he is often unable to fulfil his duty in the
world. Equally, he knows within his thought that duty is essential
and that, ultimately, nature can have no power to prevent its fulfil-
ment. He is thus bound by the very idea of duty to think of nature as
ultimately being in harmony with morality. This is not just wishful
thinking; moral consciousness must think of the harmony of moral-
ity and nature – and thus of morality and happiness – ‘as something

that necessarily is’. That is, it must postulate the existence of such harmony in spite of its discouraging experience (§602/397). Moral consciousness is also led by its experience to further postulates. As an individual, the moral self not only confronts external nature, but also has a sensuous nature of its own in the shape of desires and inclinations (§603/398). It aims to satisfy these inclinations in all its actions; yet it also understands duty to govern its actions. The moral self feels bound, therefore, to fulfil its duty in the actions it undertakes to satisfy its inclinations. That is to say, it feels bound to promote the unity of duty and inclination. Yet our particular inclinations are always found to be at odds with our pure, universal will. In face of this experience, however, moral consciousness does not abandon the task of reconciling duty and inclination. Rather, it postulates that, despite our current experience, our sensuous nature will eventually be brought into ‘conformity with morality’, albeit only after an infinite amount of time (§603/398–9).

Hegel notes, too, that moral consciousness confronts many
different situations in the world, which require it to fulfil its duty
in many different ways. It thus finds itself subject to many different
duties (§605/400). Yet what consciousness heeds in those many
duties is the element of pure duty alone; there is nothing sacred
in their particular content. Nonetheless, consciousness understands
these different duties and their content to be necessary. Since it finds
nothing within its own concept of duty that would sanctify the
content of such duties, it postulates ‘another consciousness, which
makes them sacred’ (§606/401). The latter is not only conscious of
pure duty, but also knows all the particular things one must do to
conform to duty. It is thus not just another finite moral consciousness,
but a source of wisdom and holiness beyond the finite self: the ‘lord
and ruler of the world’ (§606/401). Moral consciousness, in other
words, postulates the existence of God.
The postulates of moral consciousness overlap in many respects
with those identified by Kant in the Critique of Practical Reason
(1788). 74 Note, however, that Hegel is here not examining Kant’s
moral philosophy in particular, and so is not trying to be ‘fair’
to Kant. He is analysing the shape of moral spirit that is made
necessary logically by the experience of absolute freedom. He
now exposes the ‘pretence’ (Verstellung) at the heart of morality,
(§617/405).

Morality, we discover, is not serious about anything in its ­world-view. 

Three brief examples will suffice to show what Hegel has in mind:

Consider the first postulate. Moral consciousness regards the harmony of morality and nature as a mere postulate, because it takes there to be no such harmony in actuality. Yet consciousness understands moral action to be the fulfilment of duty in the world. It thus takes such action to bring the actual world – nature itself – into harmony with morality. Through its action, therefore, consciousness shows that it does not seriously hold the harmony of morality and nature to be a mere postulate after all (§618/406). Moral consciousness takes the world to be indifferent to morality, and so can embark on moral action, only if it postulates that the world is in fact in harmony with morality. Its very action demonstrates, however, that it only pretends to regard such harmony as just a postulate. 
Duty vs Inclination
A further pretence can be discerned in the second postulate. Consciousness takes universal duty to be at odds with particular inclination. Yet it also aims to fulfil its duty in actions that satisfy inclinations and so to bring about the unity of duty and inclination. Indeed, it postulates that this unity must be and will be achieved. It shows that it does not take its own postulate seriously, however, by projecting such unity into an infinitely remote beyond (§622/410). Consciousness is guilty of pretence, therefore, because it declares moral perfection to lie in overcoming the struggle between morality and sensuous inclination, but it is content to continue indefinitely in a state of moral imperfection (§§623–4/410). In confronting different situations in the world, consciousness finds itself subject to many different duties. Yet its own sense of pure duty cannot sanctify the particular content of these duties. 
Consciousness is led, therefore, to formulate its third postulate: that there exists a God who sanctifies these different duties and so is a ‘holy lawgiver’ (§626/411). Yet consciousness takes its own sense of pure duty to be absolute and holds to be sacred only what it can judge to be so. It is thus ‘not really in earnest about letting something be made sacred by another consciousness than itself’ (§626/412). Consciousness postulates the existence of a holy lawgiver, therefore, whose authority it only pretends to acknowledge. As consciousness becomes aware of these (and other) examples of pretence in its moral world-view, it accuses itself of hypocrisy – of ‘assert[ing] that to be true which it holds to be untrue’ (§631/414). Since, however, it takes itself to be a pure moral consciousness it flees such pretence and draws back into itself. Yet to the extent that it remains a moral consciousness, it remains mired in pretence and hypocrisy. Indeed, its very claim to have rejected hypocrisy would simply be another instance of it (§631/415).

In particular, so Hegel rather contentiously argued, it led to a kind of moralistic dissembling about what one’s real motives are, and the postulation of all kinds of extraneous matters to make the otherwise self-contradictory moralistic system work. Inevitably, such a monological point of view leads – so Hegel equally contentiously argues – to a kind of ethics of conviction, where it is always ultimately the individual’s own judgment call as to what his or her conscience requires, and the monadic and monological conception of self-conscious life inevitably point in the direction of an ever-more contracted sense of subjectivity and what it really implies.


	<h4>Conscience</h4>

The end-point of that logic is the Romantic version of an older idea of “beautiful souls,” those whose inward purity and rigor contrasts sharply with the messiness of the world around it. Rather than being the high point of post-revolutionary life, however, the arrival of the beautiful soul on the scene signals its complete breakdown. An inner life so radically cut off from others might think of itself as indeed beautiful and pure, but ultimately there is nothing to it, and, left to itself, its initial glow quickly dies like a burning ember, it fades out like a bell rung only once, and finally evaporates into thin air. It is alone, friendless, and without justice. In his staging of the breakdown of the “beautiful soul” as a way of living, Hegel imagines a confrontation between two beautiful souls, with each accusing the other of hypocrisy (of not really being in reality so pure) and even of radical evil, since it accuses the other of putting self-love in place of the moral law. One of them comes to understand this about both of them, and he confesses, avowing his own radical evil, but the other, stiff-necked and rigoristic, refuses to conciliate. That is an impossible position, Hegel says, and such a stance either consumes itself in its own self-absorption, or eventually its own isolated life is too much to bear, its hard heart breaks, and the two reconcile. With that, the purely monological, monadic form collapses, and the I/You dyadic form is recaptured. Intriguingly, Hegel then asserts that in such a two-in-one of forgiveness and reconciliation, God actually appears in their midst.


</section>
<section id="religion">
	<h2>Religion</h2>

That launches Hegel into the penultimate chapter, titled “Religion.” 


	<h3>Natural Religion</h3>

The Hegelian “phenomenology” of religion takes it to progress from a kind of Zoroastrian “religion of light” – where light is taken as the perfect symbolic representation of what infinity would, as it were, look like – to religions that represent the supersensible as some kind of life itself (as abstracted plants or animals) and in its final, fully symbolic form up to something like ancient Egyptian religion, where the abstracted animal forms and human forms are combined.


	<h4>Light</h4>
	<h4>Life</h4>
	<h4>Artisan</h4>

	<h3>Art Religion</h3>

Out of that type of natural religion comes the ancient Greek religion with its representations of the gods of Olympus as having an almost fully human form. The crucial thing about Greek religion was its being the religion of “true spirit,” which meant that in it, beauty was considered to be at one with truth. The beautiful Greek gods were the truth of what we mortals
in our daily activities are really doing. This idea in turn leads Hegel into
a discussion of the nature of Greek sculpture, epic, tragedy, and comedy,
which form the outlines of his later much more elaborated and nuanced
lectures on the philosophy of art in Berlin in the 1820s. Alas, that will have
to be left aside in this short overview.
Greek religion fades out as Greek life fades out. It was essentially an aesthetic solution to a set of real problems, and as the real problems mounted
up, it was clear that another merely aesthetic solution to the real problems
would be inadequate. 



	<h4>Abstract Art</h4>
	<h4>Living Art</h4>
	<h4>Spiritual Art</h4>

	<h3>Revealed Religion</h3>

So far we have seen two kinds of religions that mirror the previous stages of consciousness. Natural religions had conscious deities, and art religions had self-conscious deities. Natural religions came to their beliefs through observing nature, and art religions came to their beliefs through their own actions. Natural religions had an ethical spirit to them, and art religions had a cultural spirit. What follows should represent the logical third of all of these one-sided paths, a religion with a deity of spirit (or community), a religion that comes to its beliefs practically, a religion with a moral spirit.

The third chapter of religion does not contain this kind of religion. Instead it contains all three. But where could we find a religion with a divinity split into three parts: one conscious, one self-conscious, and one spirit? Hopefully you can see where this is going - when I first realized what this part was about it blew my mind and I hope it blows yours too. Hegel was a Christian and maybe it seems a bit suspect for his study of religion in this section to end with the religion he happened to be raised under - but Christianty fits into this system better than you might expect.

Firstly there is the Trinity. Not only does this sound like Triad, but it contains God, who is conscious, Jesus, who is self-conscious, and the Holy Spirit, which is Spirit.
</section>
<section id="absolute-knowing">
	<h2>Absolute Knowing</h2>

We now, at last, move on to Absolute Knowledge - the final chapter of the book. 

Now would be a good place to discuss the title of the book. (It's not too late?) 
The book actually has 3 titles:

System of Science pt 1
Science of the Experience of Consciousness
Phänomenologie des Geistes

These titles raise some questions: Why is this part 1? Is there a part 2? What does this book have to do with science?

The answer to the first two questions is: yes. This book is actually part 1 of a two part series called the System of Science, the first part called the Science of the Experience of Consciousness and the second part called the Science of Logic. The purpose of these two books is going to be explained in this final chapter of the Phenomenology, or as we may now want to call it the Science of the Experience of Consciousness.

The chapter begins with a look back at everything covered so far: negating consciousness and self-consciousness because of their one-sidedness, negating observing reason and active reason, but affirming practical reason through spirit. Negating ethical spirit and then cultural spirit only to affirm moral spirit with religion. Then negating natural religion and art religion before affirming the revealed religion. What is revealed religion affirmed with though? It is affirmed with this section that we're in now. 

“These are the moments which compose the reconciliation of spirit with its own consciousness. By themselves they are single and isolated; and it is their spiritual unity alone which furnishes the power for this reconciliation. The last of these moments [the moment we are in right now] is this unity itself. [the unity of all the moments]”

So what is his point? Well he is portraying the book we have just been through as a negative book, one that goes through all the different possibilities and negates them and moves on to the next stage until we are left with just one possibility. 

So where do we go from here?

Hegel finishes off his description of this stage by saying “Spirit having won the Notion, displays its existence and movement in this ether of its life and is Science. In this the moments of its movement no longer exhibit themselves as speciﬁc shapes of consciousness, but as speciﬁc Notions.”

What Hegel is explaining here is that after finishing all of the negations, we are finally ready to engage in Science - the whole point of this two book series - and the way we are going to engage in science is, as he says, by analysing the moments of the movement of spirit” no longer as “shapes of consciousness”, but as “Notions”. Rather than coming negatively from the perspective of experience we are now going to examine each moment positively as a set of Notions to be built from the ground up.

This work is going to be done in the second book - the Science of Logic.

Hegel finishes the book with a deliberate misquote of Friedrich Schiller:

“The chalice of this realm of spirits
Foams forth to God His own Infinitude”
