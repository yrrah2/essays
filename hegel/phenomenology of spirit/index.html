                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The Phenomenology of Spirit, or simply the Phenomenology, is a discussion about our knowledge, and the truth, and how to reduce the gap between these two concepts. Hegel’s analysis can be summed up in just two words: triadic movement. Everything for Hegel is either a movement or a moment of a movement. Art for example is a movement, whereas the Renaissance for example, is just a moment within that movement. The moments of a movement are not linear: they are triadic - they form a triad. How the triad works is that the moments are broken into three parts: first is the most basic one, then is its opposite, and finally the unity of the two. So for example in this book we first look at something from one perspective, then we look at it from the other perspective, and finally we unite the two perspectives into a new perspective.</p>

                    <h2 id="consciousness">Consciousness</h2>
                    <p>The first question we ask, in our search for the truth, is a place to start us off, a place to look at as the source of truth. The Phenomenology of Spirit was originally titled “Science of Experience of Consciousness”. This is because we start off as mere consciousness, looking to our experience of the world as a source of truth. By the end of this chapter, we find that this path leads to problems, which then leads us to take the logically opposite path: looking to ourselves as the source of truth.</p>
                    <p>If you think about how you know the truth, what comes to mind? You might say that “knowing what is true” comes from understanding and thinking about what you know and deriving the truth that way. You might say that you know what is true just from seeing and hearing the world, you know that grass really is green because you can see that it's green - maybe you don’t know some more complex truth but you know that you are seeing what you’re seeing. You might even say that it is impossible to really know the truth. </p>
                    <p>So what is Hegel’s view? Well instead of having just one view on the matter Hegel instead suggests that consciousness is a process, a development or a movement.</p>
                    <section>
                        <h3 id="sense-certainty">Sense-Certainty</h3>
                        <p>First we start with the simplest, most basic way of claiming to know the truth, which is to “accept only what is immediately sensed”. What this means is simply accepting the world for what it is and nothing more.</p>
                        <p>Contradiction 1: Immediacy vs Mediation</p>
                        <p>The first two contradicting things we encounter are immediacy and mediation:</p>
                        <p>Imagine an event takes place - maybe a crime or a sports event. If you hear about it from someone else then your knowledge of the event is mediated through them. While immediacy is the lack of mediation, Hegel would argue that directly witnessing an event might still not be pure immediacy.</p>
                        <p>If you witness an event directly your knowledge of the event might still be mediated by other things. While watching esports, even in the stadium, you are mediated by the projectors. Hegel goes so far as to say that if you see a tree and think of it as a tree then your knowledge of the object before you is mediated by your conception of what a tree is.</p>
                        <p>So if mediation covers even your own knowledge: How is it possible to have immediate knowledge? Imagine you are in a park, lying on the grass, feeling the heat, seeing the sky, and hearing the birds. If you just take it all in as senses, without thinking of the heat as heat, the sky as the sky, etc… If you simply sense and say “this is” then you have achieved simple immediacy.</p>
                        <p>Contradiction 2: Particularity vs Universality</p>
                        <p>The next conflicting concepts to look at are particularity and universality.</p>
                        <p>Simply put: particularity is the way in which something is unique, while universality is the way in which something is not unique. Is a tree particular or universal? In other words: Is a tree unique or not? Well it is unique in that it is not the same as any other tree, but it is not unique in that it has “being a tree” in common with every other tree. Knowing what a tree is, however, would be a mediation according to Hegel and therefore our initial sense-certain consciousness accepts that everything is completely unique and particular.</p>
                        <p>What form does sense-certainty’s knowledge have? As I said previously, all it can do is say: “This, here, now” referring to its sensual experience in the moment. When sense-certainty refers to “here” it could be referring to a tree if that is what it's experiencing, but “here” might later refer to a house if it turns around. The “now” might refer to night-time, but later it might refer instead to morning. Both the basic experiences, “here” and “now”, are actually universal. They are universal because all “here”s share being “here” in common, and likewise all times (all “now”s) share being “now” in common.</p>
                        <p>The consciousness thus accepts universality.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h3 id="perception">Perception</h3>
                        <p>We have transitioned to a new stage.</p>
                        <p>Our object, in sense-certainty, was the "this", but our object now is the "thing". Since we accept universality we can look at a mug and instead of simply saying "I am experiencing this" we can now say "I perceive this thing" and instead of taking in our senses we can now form concepts from it: greenness, roughness, sweetness.</p>
                        <p>The problem in this section is how a thing - for example a mug - is a unity, it's One mug, but it's also a multiplicity of properties. If we accept that every thing is a unity then we can't distinguish between any thing else. If we accept that things are a collection of properties then all we see are properties and not things. These properties, in turn, would become indistinguishable from another. The solution is to propose that properties: whiteness, roughness don't exist by themselves but they exist as a result of something else.</p>
                        <p>That idea sublates us to the next section.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3 id="understanding">Understanding</h3>
                        <p>In this final part of consciousness, instead of believing that our senses tell us the full truth, we instead use our senses to discover deeper, hidden truths. This view is roughly what most physicists believe, it's what most scientists believe, and frankly it is what most people believe full stop. The world is full of real things such as atoms, or quarks, intangible things like forces, and maybe even just mathematics itself. These things cannot be directly sensed, but it doesn't mean that they aren't real or can be discovered.</p>
                        <p>The problem that we run into with this line of thinking is how we can know anything about these underlying forces if they are invisible to our senses. How we get around this is by discovering or creating laws which explain why things happen the way they do.</p>
                        <p>This approach to unveiling the truth from behind their appearances has two major problems: Firstly he notices the trend for laws to be consolidated</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Galileo's Law of Fall explains how things fall</li>
                            <li>Kepler's Law of Planetary Motion explains how the planets move</li>
                            <li>Newton's Law of General Gravitation consolidated both those laws into one grand law</li>
                            <li>Einstein's Theory of Relativity further condensed that together with the Laws of Motion and Attraction, etc</li>
                            <li></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The consolidation of laws into grand laws actually makes them less specific, less useful, and makes you understand less about the world.</p>
                        <p>The second issue is that laws don't actually explain anything. They merely describe things. Laws don't help explain why things happen at all. The more laws we create, or discover, we never actually get any closer. This realization finally tears down this view of taking our experiences of the other as true, and we move to the opposite position, that the source of truth is from ourselves. The name of this stage is thus self-consciousness - we are conscious of our selves.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>When the consciousness was certain of the other, the existence of the self was causing problems like universality and unity. These internal conflicts, between the self and the self, were driving the movement in consciousness from one stage to another.</p>
                        <p>Now that self-consciousness is certain of the self, the existence of the other will cause problems. These external conflicts, between the self and the other, are going to drive the movement between stages in 3 parts starting with the conflict between the self and other objects.</p>
                        <section>
                            <h3 id="self-vs-other-objects">Self vs Other Objects</h3>
                            <p>When we come across objects, they initially pose an interesting problem. If all I believe in is myself, what should I think about these objects in the world that are not me? The answer to this problem is actually relatively simple: we can just assert that objects are a part of ourselves. We can assimilate them into ourselves and assert that objects in the world are merely constructions of our own thoughts.</p>

                            <p>The real problem arises when we encounter another self-consciousness. Other objects can be a part of our own creation, but other people clearly represent something equal to ourselves, it isn't so easy to just write them off as a mere object in my world if I see that they have just as much right to do the same of me. There are two paths we can take with this problem:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> the first we are both objects -> consciousness</li>
                                <li> second ignore our worries and press on in viewing other people as mere objects in our world</li>
                                <li>third accept that I am part of their world.</li>
                                <li>fourth comes later</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Hegel then begins to tell a story where two people engage in a "struggle to the death". At some point in the struggle one of the two gives in and says “You win, do what you want, but dont kill me.”  This results in an imbalanced relationship famously titled Herrschaft und Knechtschaft - translated as Master and Slave, or Lordship and Bondage.</p>
                            <p>The lord (the winner of the struggle) then puts the bondsman (the loser of the struggle) to work. The bondsman is sent out to find and make objects for the lord to satisfy their desires. This dynamic, however, leads the lord to become lazy and complacent and the bondsman, who is doing all the work, to develop their skills and become more developed.</p>
                            <p>This story, known as the “Master-Slave dialectic”, is by far the most well known section of the Phenomenology and is Hegel’s way of presenting two problems with self-certainty:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you assert that certainty only extends to your own self and to no other selves, in other words taking the position of the Lord, then the problem of the existence of other selves is solved: you can assimilate them into your world as part of yourself. The problem with this is that it provides no path for the development that Hegel is looking for.</li>
                                <li>If you instead acknowledge the existence of others, you are taking the same philosophical view as the Bondsman. Hegel is much more interested in this position because he says that it leads to further development through analysing the problem of freedom. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Hegel moves on to two philosophies that look as if they might solve this problem:</p>
                            <p>The first is Stoicism, which is philosophy that originated in ancient Greece and Rome and was believed by many actual slaves of the time. Stoicism’s main idea that we can draw back into ourselves. Sure there might be wars, or famines, or I might literally be a slave, but at least I can draw back into my own mind and find that I at least have my own inner freedom.</p>
                            <p>This is a nice solution but where stoicism falls down is that it then begins to introduce concepts such as good, wisdom, and virtue. These concepts have no basis in stoicism. Hegel will reintroduce these concepts later but only after laying down a foundation for them. Stoicism tells you to draw into your own thought but then pulls out alien concepts from somewhere else.</p>
                            <p>Hegel then moves on to Skepticism. Skepticism is similar to stoicism except for the additional concepts. When it comes to certainty, skepticism has none. Hegel views skepticism as an ideological pit that you can fall into with few ways out. His main issue with skepticism is that it provides no freedom. For the slave analogy the slave does get a sense of freedom from the flawed perspective of stoicism, but gets nothing out of skepticism. As for the actual topic of the book, certainty, we get absolutely nothing from skepticism.</p>

                            <h3 id="self-vs-divinity">Self vs Divinity</h3>
                            <p>The failure of stoicism and skepticism to arrive at freedom or certainty leads us to become what Hegel calls "Unhappy Consciousness". To break out of this unhappiness, Hegel begins a new story: this time about God.</p>
                            <p>Hegel presents God as a static, unchanging, infinite being. We on the other hand are changing, finite beings. God is universal, whereas we are merely particular. Most importantly, God is an example of a perfect self-consciousness: when it comes to encountering other objects, God is universal, and as such they are a part of God; when it comes to encountering self-consciousnesses, they exist within God too.</p>
                            <p>The story begins with a self-consciousness entering into a subservient relationship with God, mirroring the master-slave relationship from before. This time, however, the self-consciousness is happy to take that position with respect to God rather than a mere self-consciousness like themselves. As the self-consciousness tries to get closer to the divine, it requires a “divine mediator” AKA a priest. They completely devote themself to the priest and surrender whatever they possess to them. However, as they get closer to the priest, the more they realise that the priest is just another self-consciousness like them, and that the priest has no greater connection to God than they do. After this, they try to bypass the priest as an unnecessary mediator and gain access to God directly. This leads them to a revelation: The unchanging, the thing being desired throughout self-consciousness  is, in the end, reason.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>We now enter a new section of the book where we don't simply take the self to be the most basic truth, nor simply the other, but instead we take them both together as one unity: I am everything, everything is me. Hegel calls this view of being all reality “idealism”. Initially, however, it is “empty idealism” because there is no positive reason to believe in this idealism, but it is believed regardless.</p>
                        <p>The new goal is to “fill” this empty idealism. What we need to know our place in the world. We need to look at the world and see our place in it, and we need to look at ourselves and see the world in us. How we will do this is triadically: first we will observe the world and try to find our place in it that way, then we will try to make our place in the world through our own actions, and finally we will explore a union of the two ways.</p>

                                <p>Once again we will begin with immediacy, which in this case is viewing ourselves as mere physical objects. Objects which obey, and can be predicted by, the laws of motion, chemistry, etc… </p>
                                <p>The laws that apply to chemicals and moving objects for example are very rigid and predictable, but there are some elements of the Natural world that cannot be explained purely through the Natural Laws: living things may fall in the same way as rocks, and they might boil or freeze at expected temperatures, but they are still completely unpredictable from the perspective of these simple laws.</p>
                            </section>

                                <h4 id="observing-organic-nature">Observing Organic Nature</h4>
                                <p>We then move on to observation of Organic Nature
                                    In this shape we now split Nature into two parts: Organic and Inorganic. The Observations that we learned in the Observation of Nature still apply here, but to understand and predict the specific behaviour of the Organic beings we must create new laws to bring order to this new stage. With organic beings we are also closer to seeing ourselves in the world: It is no coincidence that the focus of this new stage, which we singled out as not containing order, also bears a closer resemblance to ourselves. While we are a Natural thing, we identify even more with being an Organic thing: this shape of Observing Reason sees ourselves as a homo sapien. At the same time when we look at an organic thing we can see a real and believable purpose. In fact organic things have two kinds of purpose: firstly organisms are born with features such as claws which clearly are there for a reason and therefore indicate purpose of some kind, secondly organisms react to things as they happen and show a much more relatable purpose for us.
                                    Hegel refers to this purpose, both types, as the “Inner” of an organism , in contrast with its “Outer” which is all the physical versions of the Inner Purpose. Since there is no “purpose” part of our body, Hegel separates this Inner into 3 parts:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sensitivity - which refers to a organism’s  senses, the way it is made aware of the world</li>
                                    <li>Irritability - which concerns the organism’s reactions</li>
                                    <li>Reproduction - which concerns the self-preservation of an organism</li>
                                </ul>
                                The Outer equivalents for these Inner parts are
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The nervous system</li>
                                    <li>The muscular system</li>
                                    <li>The digestive and reproductive systems</li>
                                </ul>
                                Now once again we start identifying problems:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Organisms’ purposes cannot be broken into parts because they actually function as one whole</li>
                                    <li>Organisms’ biology also cannot be broken up because it would kill them</li>
                                </ul>
                            </section>
                            <section>
                                <h4 id="observing-self-consciousness">Observing Self-Consciousness</h4>
                                <p>Finally we move to Observation of Self-consciousness. This approach tries to fit us into the world as humans, but more specifically self-consciousnesses. Beings which not only have thought but self-conscious thought. Again we divide it into inner and outer parts.</p>
                                <p>The first approach taken is to observe logical laws about our thoughts (e.g. a thought cannot be true and false), but this is far too limited, and can't help us predict human behaviour. The next obvious approach to observing our inner is through psychology. Psychology looks at our experiences and our past to understand and predict our actions, and it can be a powerful tool, but it is inneffective at creating laws. There may be relationships between one particular experience and one particular action. For example there may be a link between poverty and alcoholism, there may be a link between what country you are born in and what sports team you support. The problem is that your actions are actually determined by all of your experiences. Interestingly, one of the choices that we make in our lives, is which experiences our ours make up who we are.</p>
                                <p>We then move to the second part of Observing The Outer. Hegel's two examples were Physiognomy and Phrenology. Physiognomy is the study of people’s physical appearance and in particular their face (you can tell if someone is honest or dishonest by their face). Phrenology is the study of people’s skulls (Thieves might all have a specific bump in a specific part of their skull). </p>
                                <p>Hegel’s critique of these disciplines can be applied to modern ones, such as racism, horoscopes, zodiacs, etc… </p>
                                <p>Their problems stems from the fact that they simply notice some empty correlations and don't successfully justify the link. It is the same thing is saying it always rains when I put my washing out to dry. There may be a link, but without reasoning it is empty.</p>
                                <p>Hegel closes off the Observing Reason section with a dick joke, where he says that we can't even explain why the highest and the lowest of our bodies - the highest being sex and the lowest being urination - both involve the genitals.</p>
                                <p>“The ignorance of this consciousness about what it says are the same kind of connection of higher and lower which, in the case of the living being, nature itself naively expresses in the combination of the organ of its highest fulfillment, the organ of generation, with the organ of urination.”</p>
                                <p>He then finishes with a pun by saying that thus far all we have been doing is effectively “pissing around”.</p>
                                <p>“The infinite judgment as infinite would be the completion of self-comprehending life, whereas the consciousness of the infinite judgment which remains within representational thought conducts itself like pissing.”</p>

                            <p>This moves us from observing reason to active reason. Before we were finding our place in the world through observation, but in now we will make our place in the world through our actions.

                                <h4 id="pleasure-and-necessity">Pleasure and Necessity</h4>
                                <p>The first approach is through pursuing pleasure. This is an approach that many people take in life: we are here to be happy and have pleasure, and that is all that life is about. My place in the world is not something natural, but something that I do by having a satisfying life. The problem with this world view, of course, comes from the the way that the world intrudes in on us. It is just like in self-consciousness, when the other intruded on our self-certainty, but here it is the necessities of the world that interupt our peace. Things such as having to earn money, having to be warm and eat food, etc…</p>

                                <h4 id="law-of-the-heart">Law of the Heart</h4>
                                <p>The contradiction between pursuing pleasure and the intrusion of outside necessity moves us to a new stage where we now focus on pursuing our own vision for the world, and pushing our views onto others. This section is labeled the Law of our Heart. Back in observing reason, we were observing all kinds of phsical laws, biological laws, but now the Law of the Heart is one we create. In pursuing the Law of the Heart we initially rally against the state, the church and the social order as enemies of our law.</p>
                                <p>But this stage has two major flaws. Firstly others will see my law being imposed on them the same way I see the intitutions that I am resisting being imposed on me. Secondly others have their own laws of their own hearts, which they will be imposing upon me equally. This conflict between the different laws of different hearts leads to a breakdown of this stage, where we enter a period of self-conceit, hateful of the world whcih we are too powerless to change.</p>

                                <p>We then move on to the third stage, where we reject the Way of the World, which consists of millions of inidividuals pushing against each other with their own wills, and instead draw into ourselves and act as a knight of virtue. Rather than pushing for our own personal Law of our Heart, we instead pursue virtue - a universal and selfless good. This approach, however, suffers from its own arrogance. Virtue utters ‘empty, ineffectual words’ which ‘edify, but raise no edifice’</p>

                            <p>The emptiness we are left with at the end of virtue brings us to Practical Reason. This stage begins to focus on what makes us, us - our individuality.</p>
                            <p>If you think about "what makes you, you", there are two main perspectives: firstly that I am an individual because I share qualities with other individuals, the second perspective is that I am an individual because I am different from other individuals - I am not them, I am this individual. These two opposing approaches can be found in the previous two sections. In observing reason we looked to see what made us the same as other things: we are the same because we are physical objects, we are animals, we are people. The other view was found in active reason where we came into conflict with others due to our differences. Here we are going to unify the two.</p>
                            <section>
                                <h4 id="spiritual-animal-kingdom">Spiritual Animal Kingdom</h4>
                                <p>Our first attempt to find a unity is in action. In Observing Reason, the problem with Physiognomy was that we were looking at just one action and thinking of it as a persons true nature. Now we can look at all of a person's actions in their entirety as an expression of themselves.</p>
                                <p>In this view, every individual has an inner purpose which causes us to perform the actions that we perform. We have the inner purpose from observing reason, but we require the individual to make active contributions on the world too.</p>
                                <p>So my actions express who I am, the actions of others express who they are. The problem is that sometimes I make mistakes, and sometimes I have an idea in my head which my actions don’t successfully carry out and as a result I feel alienated when I look back on my own actions. Additionally when I look back on my prior actions I see the work of a different person, someone who has different views and experiences to the current me.</p>

                                <h4 id="law-giving-reason">Law-Giving Reason</h4>
                                <p>In this shape of reason, the objective is still the so called “what really matters” but instead of individual against individual we see that “what really matters” is the object of the whole community AKA the “ethical community”. Hegel moves on from referring to it as “what really matters” to calling it “ethical substance” because we are concerned with the substance of the ethical community, with the substance of ethics itself. We are still in the reason section, however, and therefore we as individuals will try to determine this ethical substance for ourselves. The first approach is, of course, the immediate one: if the ethical substance is universal for everyone then it should be immediately obvious. This is where we start to come up with maxims which seem obvious to us such as </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>“Everyone ought to speak the truth.” - The problem with this is that not everyone knows the truth, so the maxim has to be changed to</li>
                                    <li>“Everyone ought to speak the truth if they know it.” - The problem with this maxim is that no one can know if what they think it really the truth, so we have to change the maxim to</li>
                                    <li>“Everyone ought to speak what they think.” - At this point the maxim is so watered down that it has become meaningless.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This problem of obvious maxims being watered down leads us to the next stage.</p>

                                <p>The next stage is called “Law-testing Reason” and it is partially based on Emmanuel Kant's idea that we can arrive at a moral law by thinking it through logically. To analyze this idea he uses the idea of property, as in the idea that certain objects can belong to some individuals:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This idea is important because it governs things like theft</li>

                                        Property in and of itself has no logical contradictions, since it is just a simple idea
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Lack of property has no logical contradictions either</li>

                                <p>The first historical setting that Hegel examines is Ancient Greece.</p>
                                <p>Hegel tells us that ethics in Ancient Greece was split into two parts:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The first is what he calls the “Family Sphere”. This side was dominated by women, the family and the gods. For men the family sphere was most important at birth and growing up, and then at death.</li>
                                    <li>The family sphere is contrasted with the “State Sphere”. This side was dominated by men, the state, and the military. For men the state sphere is where they spend most of their life, before returning to the family sphere.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This system initially seems functional: women can be in charge of family related issues like burials and weddings, while men can be in charge of state and war. While it is not progressive or ideal, it at least appears to function. Hegel points out, however, that in cases where the two spheres come into conflict there is no resolution.</p>
                                <p>To explain his point he uses the 5th Century BCE play “Antigone” by Sophocles. In the play a man named Polynices dies in a civil war for the control of the city Thebes. After the civil war, the new king Creon publicly condemns Polynices and rules that he cannot be formally buried. This presents a problem for Polynices’ sister, Antigone: should she obey the state and refuse to perform a burial for her brother, or should she obey the gods?</p>
                                <p>The point Hegel is making with a reference to this play is that there is no correct solution, at least not using Greece’s ethical system.</p>

                                <p>We then move on to Ancient Rome which still uses an ethical system but this one is a singular sphere all under the legitimacy of the emperor.</p>

                            <p>Moral spirit is another one of Hegel's critiques of Immanuel Kant. This time he does so in the context of the breakdown of the french revolution, where he critique's Kant's attempt to build a moral system from the remanants of that moral decay.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>That launches us into the penultimate chapter, titled “Religion.” In religion we do the same thing that we did for the spirit section, which is to analyze and categorize religions according to Hegel's triadic structure.</p>
                        <section>
                            <h3>Natural Religion</h3>
                            <p>The first set of religions are called natural religions. They mirror the consciousness, observing reason, and the ethical spirit sections. Firstly they worship conscious deities, secondly they come to their religion through observation, and finally they see their religion as coming from an outside divinity. Like how ethical spirit was objective spirit - natural religion is objective religion.</p>
                            <p>Natural religions are divided into three sections: light, life, and artisan.</p>
                            <p>"Light" religions worship light or some other immaterial being. Their deities are implicitly conscious, but not explicitly. "Life" religions worship animals or parts of nature. "Artisan" is Hegel's term for the Egyptian religion which had animal-human hybrids for deities.</p>
                            <p>These religions form an obvious progression: we start with an implicitly conscious divine, then move to explicitly divine, then to a half-conscious half-self-conscious divine, before moving later to the next section with self-conscious divinity. The Egyptian religion also acts as a transition from the observational religions to active religions, because they built things like obelisks, pyramids and sphinxs.</p>

                            <h3>Art Religion</h3>
                            <p>We then move on to Art Religions, which is Hegel's term for Greek religion. In the Greek religion, the gods were self-conscious people. Greek religion doesn't observe its deities in nature, nor does it think of its beliefs as objective, coming from outside. Instead this religion mirrors active reason and cultural spirit. The religious practice comes from the actions of its believers, and the beliefs come from those actions. These actions come in the form of art, which is split into three parts:</p>
                            <p>First we have abstract works of art. This starts with statues, which have permanence but no individuality, followed by hymns which have individuality but no permanence, all of which culminates in the Greek cults, which had performed rituals involving statues and hymns.</p>
                            <p>Second is living works of art. Here, Hegel describes the Olympian tradition as the second practice in his analysis of Greek religion. The Olympians treated their own bodies as works of art.</p>
                            <p>Third is spiritual works of art, where spiritual of course refers to collective or communal practices. This is found in Greek epics, tragedies and comedies. Epics, tragedies and comedies on the one hand are created and acted out by the religious community, but on the other hand literally believed by the community too. This shows how active the greek religions really were in contrast to the natural religions.</p>
                            <p>It is actually in the analysis of Greek comedies that the transition into the next stage takes place, which is to Revealed Religion.</p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3>Revealed Religion</h3>
                            <p>So far we have seen two kinds of religions that mirror the previous stages of consciousness. Natural religions had conscious deities, and art religions had self-conscious deities. Natural religions came to their beliefs through observing nature, and art religions came to their beliefs through their own actions. Natural religions had an ethical spirit to them, and art religions had a cultural spirit. What follows should represent the logical third of all of these one-sided paths, a religion with a deity of spirit (or community), a religion that comes to its beliefs practically, a religion with a moral spirit.</p>
                            <p>The third chapter of religion does not contain this kind of religion. Instead it contains all three. But where could we find a religion with a divinity split into three parts: one conscious, one self-conscious, and one spirit? Hopefully you can see where this is going - when I first realized what this part was about it blew my mind and I hope it blows yours too. Hegel was a Christian and maybe it seems a bit suspect for his study of religion in this section to end with the religion he happened to be raised under - but Christianty fits into this system better than you might expect.</p>
                            <p>Firstly there is the Trinity. Not only does this sound like Triad, but it contains God, who is conscious, Jesus, who is self-conscious, and the Holy Spirit, which is Spirit.</p>

                    <p>We now, at last, move on to Absolute Knowledge - the final chapter of the book. </p>
                    <p>The chapter begins with a look back at everything covered so far: TBD</p>
                    <p>All of these stages, these moments of consciousness, are single and isolated. But the last moment it the unity of all of them. The last moment that we look at is the moment that we art left with after studying all the previous moments. ; and it is their spiritual unity alone which furnishes the power for this reconciliation. In other words the Phenomenology of Spirit starts with analyzing different kinds of consciousness, and ends with the kind of consciousness that we are left with after having read it.</p>
                    <p>So where do we go from here?</p>
                    <p>The book is actually titled "System of Science pt 1: Phänomenologie des Geistes"</p>
                    <p>After finishing all of the negations, we are finally ready to engage in Science - the whole point of this two book series - and the way we are going to engage in science is by analysing the Notions. Rather than coming negatively from the perspective of experience we are now going to examine each moment positively as a set of Notions to be built from the ground up.</p>
                    <p>This work is going to be done in the second book - the Science of Logic.</p>
                    <p>Hegel finishes the book with a deliberate misquote of Friedrich Schiller:</p>
                    <p>“The chalice of this realm of spirits
Foams forth to God His own Infinitude”
