# Introduction

The Phenomenology of Spirit, or simply the Phenomenology, is a discussion about our knowledge, and the truth, and how to reduce the gap between these two concepts. Hegel’s analysis can be summed up in just two words: triadic movement. Everything for Hegel is either a movement or a moment of a movement. Art for example is a movement, whereas the Renaissance for example, is just a moment within that movement. The moments of a movement are not linear: they are triadic - they form a triad. How the triad works is that the moments are broken into three parts: first is the most basic one, then is its opposite, and finally the unity of the two. So for example in this book we first look at something from one perspective, then we look at it from the other perspective, and finally we unite the two perspectives into a new perspective.

The first question we look at is finding some basis to work off of, in our search for the truth. The Phenomenology of Spirit was originally titled “Science of Experience of Consciousness”.

# Consciousness

The Phenomenology begins with the consciousness which Hegel defines as the part of each person that is trying to “unify knowledge and truth”, in other words the part that is trying to know what is true. If you think about how you know the truth, what comes to mind? You might say that “knowing what is true” comes from understanding and thinking about what you know and deriving the truth that way. You might say that you know what is true just from seeing and hearing the world, you know that grass really is green because you can see that it's green - maybe you don’t know some more complex truth but you know that you are seeing what you’re seeing. You might even say that it is impossible to really know the truth. 

So what is Hegel’s view? Well instead of having just one view on the matter Hegel instead suggests that consciousness is a process, a development or a movement. He takes the different views on consciousness from different philosophers throughout history and instead of adding his own new view, he places all those other views onto a line from beginning to end.

## Sense-certainty

First we take the most basic form of consciousness, in other words the most basic way of claiming to know the truth, which Hegel says is when you “accept only what is immediately sensed”. What this means is simply accepting the world for what it is and nothing more. 

Contradiction 1: Immediacy vs Mediation

The first two contradicting things we encounter are immediacy and mediation:

Imagine an event takes place - maybe a crime or a sports event. If you hear about it from someone else then your knowledge of the event is mediated through them. While immediacy is the lack of mediation, Hegel would argue that directly witnessing an event might still not be pure immediacy. 

If you witness an event directly your knowledge of the event might still be mediated by other things. While watching esports, even in the stadium, you are mediated by the projectors. Hegel goes so far as to say that if you see a tree and think of it as a tree then your knowledge of the object before you is mediated by your conception of what a tree is. 

So if mediation covers even your own knowledge: How is it possible to have immediate knowledge? Imagine you are in a park, lying on the grass, feeling the heat, seeing the sky, and hearing the birds. If you just take it all in as senses, without thinking of the heat as heat, the sky as the sky, etc… If you simply sense and say “this is” then you have achieved simple immediacy.

Contradiction 2: Particularity vs Universality

The next conflicting concepts to look at are particularity and universality.

Simply put: particularity is the way in which something is unique, while universality is the way in which something is not unique. Is a tree particular or universal? In other words: Is a tree unique or not? Well it is unique in that it is not the same as any other tree, but it is not unique in that it has “being a tree” in common with every other tree. Knowing what a tree is, however, would be a mediation according to Hegel and therefore our initial sense-certain consciousness accepts that everything is completely unique and particular.

What form does sense-certainty’s knowledge have? As I said previously, all it can do is say: “This, here, now” referring to its sensual experience in the moment. When sense-certainty refers to “here” it could be referring to a tree if that is what it's experiencing, but “here” might later refer to a house if it turns around. The “now” might refer to night-time, but later it might refer instead to morning. Both the basic experiences, “here” and “now”, are actually universal. They are universal because all “here”s share being “here” in common, and likewise all times (all “now”s) share being “now” in common.

The consciousness thus accepts universality.

## Perception

What is happening now is called, by Hegel, Aufhebung which is usually translated to sublation. What it means is that we have transitioned to a new stage. We moved past accepting only immediacy and uniqueness, but we haven't negated it: we haven't accepted only universality, we now accept both. We don't accept the original, nor the opposite, so we have sublated to a higher stage. 

Where the object of sense-certainty was the "this", the object of perception is the "thing". Now that we accept universality we can look at a mug and instead of simply saying "I am experiencing this" we can now say "I perceive this thing" and instead of taking in our senses we can now form concepts from it: greenness, roughness, sweetness. 

So what is the contradiction that we are dealing with in this section? Hegel is going to play around with a concept that he uses lots of different terms for:

* Unity and Multiplicity
* The One and the Also
* Intrinsic distinctiveness and Extrinsic diversity

What he is describing is how a thing - for example a mug - is a unity, it's One mug, and it's also a multiplicity of qualities: it's also white, it's also round, it's also solid, smooth, etc… Intrinsic distinctiveness is the same thing: the thing is intrinsically distinctive from other things but it also exhibits extrinsic diversity with its many qualities. 

Hopefully you can see that these concepts are very similar to the old set of immediacy and mediation from sense-certainty. If we accept that every thing is a unity then we can't distinguish between any thing and we are back to sense-certainty. If we accept that things are single things and also a collection of properties then we are stuck in this unstable perception that is trying to reconcile the contradiction. If we accept only the multiplicity of properties and not the unity of the thing, then the thing ceases to be. If we did accept just that then we would have to understand that the properties: whiteness, roughness don't exist by themselves but they exist as a result of something else. 

That understanding is the namesake of the next section that we sublate to: Forces and Understanding where forces are whatever it is that is giving rise to our perceptions. 

## Understanding

We then move on to the final part of the first section. We are still in the realm of empiricism - where we believe the world exists independent of us and we are simply trying to know the truth of it - but instead of relying on our senses, and instead of relying on our perception, we now move to the last view of empiricism which is scientific empiricism. 

In Hegel's time people believed a whole variety of different things about knowing truth. Today there is a small variation but the vast majority of people are scientific empiricism so this section is about what most people believe these days. That is that the world exists by itself but we can't directly experience it's true nature. There is something that underlies this world but we cannot see it directly. You can think of this invisible thing which underlies our world as atoms, as quarks, maybe as mathematics itself, or the forces. 

The problem that we run into with this line of thinking is how we can know anything about these underlying forces if they are invisible to our senses. How scientists get around this is by observing the world and creating laws which explain why things happen the way they do. This is the system of scientific empiricism according to Hegel - what he refers to in the Phenomenology as "Understanding".

Hegel then, of course, talks about the problems in this view:

* Firstly he notices the trend for laws to be consolidated. 
** Galileo's Law of Fall explains how things fall
** Kepler's Law of Planetary Motion explains how the planets move
** Newton's Law of General Gravitation consolidated both those laws into one grand law
** Einstein's Theory of Relativity further condensed that together with the Laws of Motion and Attraction, etc
** The consolidation of laws into grand laws actually makes them less specific, less useful, and makes you understand less about the world. 
* The second issue is that laws don't actually explain anything. They merely describe things. Laws don't help explain why things happen at all. 

To overcome these problems Understanding does a very strange thing:

* The things that it experiences can be collectively referred to as the world of appearances. 
* The forces that we know of only through our laws can be called the world of laws, but Hegel calls it the supersensible world. 
* If believing in this World of Laws produces problems then we can solve it by imagining an inverted world. When he says inverted he really means inverted (Up is Down, Day is Night, Courage is Cowardice, etc…) If everything in this world is the opposite then surely those problems will go away. 
* Understanding realizes at this moment that everything that it has been doing so far has been conjured in its own consciousness. How can it invent something and then believe its own invention?

This final realization leads consciousness to make a major transformation. 

# Self-Consciousness

Up until now consciousness has had two basic beliefs:

* There is a clear distinction between the self and the other (where "the self" is the consciousness, and "the other" is everything that isn't the consciousness from the world to objects to other people) 
* The only thing to be certain of is the other

Now that we have accepted the role that our own thinking plays in our knowledge, our basic beliefs have changed:

* We still believe in the distinction between the self and other, but
* We are now first certain of the self, not the other. For this reason we now refer to our consciousness as "self-consciousness"

When the consciousness was certain of the other, the existence of the self was causing problems like universality and unity. These internal conflicts, between the self and the self, we're driving the movement in consciousness from one stage to another. 

Now that self-consciousness is certain of the self, the existence of the other will cause problems. These external conflicts, between the self and the other, are going to drive the movement between stages in 3 parts starting with the conflict between the self and other objects. 

## Self vs Other Objects

When we, as self-consciousness, come across objects Hegel says we want to assimilate them. The self-consciousness wants the objects not to be other objects anymore and instead become part of it, thereby destroying the object. When Hegel says "assimilation" and "destroying" he is dramatically referring to the way we get what we desire from an object until we can't anymore:

* Food and Drink is consumed
* Books are read and become less desirable to be read each time
* Video games are played and also become less desirable as you get better at them

This is Hegel's simple solution to the self-consciousness encountering other objects. 

## Self vs Other Selves

The real problem arises when we encounter another self-consciousness. For Hegel what we desire from other humans is to be recognized by them. But when we try to do what we did for the objects (get what we want from them, thereby assimilating them into ourselves) it doesn't work for other self-consciousnesses (others that are like us). This is because when we try to get recognition from them, they try to get recognition from us too. We can’t assimilate them so easily because they represent something equal to us.

Hegel then begins to tell a story where two people engage in a "struggle to the death". At some point in the struggle one of the two gives in and says “You win, do what you want, but dont kill me.”  This results in an imbalanced relationship famously titled Herrschaft und Knechtschaft - translated as Master and Slave, or Lordship and Bondage. 

The lord (the winner of the struggle) then puts the bondsman (the loser of the struggle) to work. The bondsman is sent out to find and make objects for the lord to satisfy their desires. This dynamic, however, leads the lord to become lazy and complacent and the bondsman, who is doing all the work, to develop their skills and become more developed.

This story, known as the “Master-Slave dialectic”, is by far the most well known section of the Phenomenology and is Hegel’s way of presenting two problems with self-certainty:

* If you assert that certainty only extends to your own self and to no other selves, in other words taking the position of the Lord, then the problem of the existence of other selves is solved: you can assimilate them into your world as part of yourself. The problem with this is that it provides no path for the development that Hegel is looking for.
* If you instead acknowledge the existence of others, you are taking the same philosophical view as the Bondsman. Hegel is much more interested in this position because he says that it leads to further development through analysing the problem of freedom. 

Hegel moves on to two philosophies that look as if they might solve this problem:

The first is Stoicism, which is philosophy that originated in ancient Greece and Rome and was believed by many actual slaves of the time. Stoicism’s main idea that we can draw back into ourselves. Sure there might be wars, or famines, or I might literally be a slave, but at least I can draw back into my own mind and find that I at least have my own inner freedom.

This is a nice solution but where stoicism falls down is that it then begins to introduce concepts such as good, wisdom, and virtue. These concepts have no basis in stoicism. Hegel will reintroduce these concepts later but only after laying down a foundation for them. Stoicism tells you to draw into your own thought but then pulls out alien concepts from somewhere else.

Hegel then moves on to Skepticism. Skepticism is similar to stoicism except for the additional concepts. When it comes to certainty, skepticism has none. Hegel views skepticism as an ideological pit that you can fall into with few ways out. His main issue with skepticism is that it provides no freedom. For the slave analogy the slave does get a sense of freedom from the flawed perspective of stoicism, but gets nothing out of skepticism. As for the actual topic of the book, certainty, we get absolutely nothing from skepticism.

## Self vs Divinity

The failure of stoicism and skepticism to arrive at freedom or certainty leads us to become what Hegel calls "Unhappy Consciousness". To break out of this unhappiness, Hegel begins a new story: this time about God.

Hegel presents God as a static, unchanging, infinite being. We on the other hand are changing, finite beings. God is universal, whereas we are merely particular. Most importantly, God is an example of a perfect self-consciousness: when it comes to encountering other objects, God is universal, and as such they are a part of God; when it comes to encountering self-consciousnesses, they exist within God too.

The story begins with a self-consciousness entering into a subservient relationship with God, mirroring the master-slave relationship from before. This time, however, the self-consciousness is happy to take that position with respect to God rather than a mere self-consciousness like themselves. As the self-consciousness tries to get closer to the divine, it requires a “divine mediator” AKA a priest. They completely devote themself to the priest and surrender whatever they possess to them. However, as they get closer to the priest, the more they realise that the priest is just another self-consciousness like them, and that the priest has no greater connection to God than they do. After this, they try to bypass the priest as an unnecessary mediator and gain access to God directly. This leads them to a revelation: The unchanging, the thing being desired throughout self-consciousness  is, in the end, reason. 

# Reason

We now enter a new section of the book where we don't simply take the self to be the most basic truth, nor simply the other, but instead we take them both together as one unity: I am everything, everything is me. Hegel calls this view of being all reality “idealism”. Initially, however, it is “empty idealism” because it is believed dogmatically. There is no positive reason to believe in this idealism but it is believed regardless.

The new goal is to “fill” this empty idealism. What we need to know our place in the world. We need to look at the world and see our place in it, and we need to look at ourselves and see the world in us. How we will do this is triadically: first we will observe the world and try to find our place in it that way, then we will try to make our place in the world through our own actions, and finally we will explore a union of the two ways.

## Observing Reason

### Observing Nature

The first thing that we observe may not seem obvious, but Hegel always wants to begin with the immediacy and so we begin with the observation of Nature. He doesn't mean living nature in particular but all of nature together. This means rocks, rivers, acids, even gravity but it also includes living nature as a part of it. When we encounter living things, however, we will observe them the same way that we observe anything else: using the laws of motion, chemistry, etc… 

This first kind of observation clearly has order in abundance. The laws that apply to chemicals and moving objects for example are very rigid and predictable. We can also see ourselves in the world using this approach: in a chemistry class you might find people saying that atoms “like” to have 8 electrons in their shells, this is known as anthropomorphism. To see yourself in the world means both to see things like you in the world, which Hegel is here employing purpose for, and also to see yourself as part of the world, which in this case means seeing ourselves as mere objects which obey the laws of physics, etc… 

We now need to start looking at the problems:

* Non-living things don't have a purpose, even if our instincts lead us to think that way
* There are some elements of the Natural world that cannot be explained purely through the Natural Laws: living things may fall in the same way as rocks, and they might boil or freeze at expected temperatures, but they are still completely unpredictable from the perspective of Natural laws
