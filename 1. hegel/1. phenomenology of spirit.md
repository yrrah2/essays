# Introduction

The Phenomenology of Spirit, or simply the Phenomenology, is a discussion about our knowledge, and the truth, and how to reduce the gap between these two concepts. Hegel’s analysis can be summed up in just two words: triadic movement. Everything for Hegel is either a movement or a moment of a movement. Art for example is a movement, whereas the Renaissance for example, is just a moment within that movement. The moments of a movement are not linear: they are triadic - they form a triad. How the triad works is that the moments are broken into three parts: first is the most basic one, then is its opposite, and finally the unity of the two. So for example in this book we first look at something from one perspective, then we look at it from the other perspective, and finally we unite the two perspectives into a new perspective.

The first question we look at is finding some basis to work off of, in our search for the truth. The Phenomenology of Spirit was originally titled “Science of Experience of Consciousness”.

# Consciousness

The Phenomenology begins with the consciousness which Hegel defines as the part of each person that is trying to “unify knowledge and truth”, in other words the part that is trying to know what is true. If you think about how you know the truth, what comes to mind? You might say that “knowing what is true” comes from understanding and thinking about what you know and deriving the truth that way. You might say that you know what is true just from seeing and hearing the world, you know that grass really is green because you can see that it's green - maybe you don’t know some more complex truth but you know that you are seeing what you’re seeing. You might even say that it is impossible to really know the truth. 

So what is Hegel’s view? Well instead of having just one view on the matter Hegel instead suggests that consciousness is a process, a development or a movement. He takes the different views on consciousness from different philosophers throughout history and instead of adding his own new view, he places all those other views onto a line from beginning to end.

## Sense-certainty

First we take the most basic form of consciousness, in other words the most basic way of claiming to know the truth, which Hegel says is when you “accept only what is immediately sensed”. What this means is simply accepting the world for what it is and nothing more. 

Contradiction 1: Immediacy vs Mediation

The first two contradicting things we encounter are immediacy and mediation:

Imagine an event takes place - maybe a crime or a sports event. If you hear about it from someone else then your knowledge of the event is mediated through them. While immediacy is the lack of mediation, Hegel would argue that directly witnessing an event might still not be pure immediacy. 

If you witness an event directly your knowledge of the event might still be mediated by other things. While watching esports, even in the stadium, you are mediated by the projectors. Hegel goes so far as to say that if you see a tree and think of it as a tree then your knowledge of the object before you is mediated by your conception of what a tree is. 

So if mediation covers even your own knowledge: How is it possible to have immediate knowledge? Imagine you are in a park, lying on the grass, feeling the heat, seeing the sky, and hearing the birds. If you just take it all in as senses, without thinking of the heat as heat, the sky as the sky, etc… If you simply sense and say “this is” then you have achieved simple immediacy.

Contradiction 2: Particularity vs Universality

The next conflicting concepts to look at are particularity and universality.

Simply put: particularity is the way in which something is unique, while universality is the way in which something is not unique. Is a tree particular or universal? In other words: Is a tree unique or not? Well it is unique in that it is not the same as any other tree, but it is not unique in that it has “being a tree” in common with every other tree. Knowing what a tree is, however, would be a mediation according to Hegel and therefore our initial sense-certain consciousness accepts that everything is completely unique and particular.

What form does sense-certainty’s knowledge have? As I said previously, all it can do is say: “This, here, now” referring to its sensual experience in the moment. When sense-certainty refers to “here” it could be referring to a tree if that is what it's experiencing, but “here” might later refer to a house if it turns around. The “now” might refer to night-time, but later it might refer instead to morning. Both the basic experiences, “here” and “now”, are actually universal. They are universal because all “here”s share being “here” in common, and likewise all times (all “now”s) share being “now” in common.

The consciousness thus accepts universality.

## Perception

What is happening now is called, by Hegel, Aufhebung which is usually translated to sublation. What it means is that we have transitioned to a new stage. We moved past accepting only immediacy and uniqueness, but we haven't negated it: we haven't accepted only universality, we now accept both. We don't accept the original, nor the opposite, so we have sublated to a higher stage. 

Where the object of sense-certainty was the "this", the object of perception is the "thing". Now that we accept universality we can look at a mug and instead of simply saying "I am experiencing this" we can now say "I perceive this thing" and instead of taking in our senses we can now form concepts from it: greenness, roughness, sweetness. 

So what is the contradiction that we are dealing with in this section? Hegel is going to play around with a concept that he uses lots of different terms for:

* Unity and Multiplicity
* The One and the Also
* Intrinsic distinctiveness and Extrinsic diversity

What he is describing is how a thing - for example a mug - is a unity, it's One mug, and it's also a multiplicity of qualities: it's also white, it's also round, it's also solid, smooth, etc… Intrinsic distinctiveness is the same thing: the thing is intrinsically distinctive from other things but it also exhibits extrinsic diversity with its many qualities. 

Hopefully you can see that these concepts are very similar to the old set of immediacy and mediation from sense-certainty. If we accept that every thing is a unity then we can't distinguish between any thing and we are back to sense-certainty. If we accept that things are single things and also a collection of properties then we are stuck in this unstable perception that is trying to reconcile the contradiction. If we accept only the multiplicity of properties and not the unity of the thing, then the thing ceases to be. If we did accept just that then we would have to understand that the properties: whiteness, roughness don't exist by themselves but they exist as a result of something else. 

That understanding is the namesake of the next section that we sublate to: Forces and Understanding where forces are whatever it is that is giving rise to our perceptions. 

## Understanding

We then move on to the final part of the first section. We are still in the realm of empiricism - where we believe the world exists independent of us and we are simply trying to know the truth of it - but instead of relying on our senses, and instead of relying on our perception, we now move to the last view of empiricism which is scientific empiricism. 

In Hegel's time people believed a whole variety of different things about knowing truth. Today there is a small variation but the vast majority of people are scientific empiricism so this section is about what most people believe these days. That is that the world exists by itself but we can't directly experience it's true nature. There is something that underlies this world but we cannot see it directly. You can think of this invisible thing which underlies our world as atoms, as quarks, maybe as mathematics itself, or the forces. 

The problem that we run into with this line of thinking is how we can know anything about these underlying forces if they are invisible to our senses. How scientists get around this is by observing the world and creating laws which explain why things happen the way they do. This is the system of scientific empiricism according to Hegel - what he refers to in the Phenomenology as "Understanding".

Hegel then, of course, talks about the problems in this view:

* Firstly he notices the trend for laws to be consolidated. 
** Galileo's Law of Fall explains how things fall
** Kepler's Law of Planetary Motion explains how the planets move
** Newton's Law of General Gravitation consolidated both those laws into one grand law
** Einstein's Theory of Relativity further condensed that together with the Laws of Motion and Attraction, etc
** The consolidation of laws into grand laws actually makes them less specific, less useful, and makes you understand less about the world. 
* The second issue is that laws don't actually explain anything. They merely describe things. Laws don't help explain why things happen at all. 

To overcome these problems Understanding does a very strange thing:

* The things that it experiences can be collectively referred to as the world of appearances. 
* The forces that we know of only through our laws can be called the world of laws, but Hegel calls it the supersensible world. 
* If believing in this World of Laws produces problems then we can solve it by imagining an inverted world. When he says inverted he really means inverted (Up is Down, Day is Night, Courage is Cowardice, etc…) If everything in this world is the opposite then surely those problems will go away. 
* Understanding realizes at this moment that everything that it has been doing so far has been conjured in its own consciousness. How can it invent something and then believe its own invention?

This final realization leads consciousness to make a major transformation.
